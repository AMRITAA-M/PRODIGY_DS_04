Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

The sentiment analysis of social media data, particularly Twitter, successfully provided insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as VADER and TextBlob, we were able to classify tweets into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The sentiment distribution revealed key patterns, with notable proportions of positive and negative sentiments depending on the specific topic or brand being analyzed. Through various visualizations, including pie charts and bar graphs, we illustrated the overall sentiment trends. Furthermore, a time-series analysis allowed us to track sentiment shifts over time, offering a dynamic view of how public perception evolved. Word clouds of positive and negative sentiments highlighted the most frequently discussed terms in each category, helping identify key topics influencing sentiment. Overall, the task provided a comprehensive understanding of public sentiment, which can be used for brand monitoring, market research, and decision-making.
